# Grzegorzâ€™s Site Blocker

A simple Chrome extension that blocks undesirable domains, e.g. domains that are
a waste of time like Reddit.

I wrote this extension, because my employer forbids the use of third-party
extensions; they are a security risk.

## Pattern cookbook

Disabling only the Reddit homepage and not subreddits: `reddit.com/$`.
